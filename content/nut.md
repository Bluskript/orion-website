Robot Design
==============

Our robot was designed to be fast, consistent, and tactical. 

By watching high level games at 2019 Robocup, we learned that speed and consistency are critical to the success of a RobocupJunior robot. 

In [Sky Crew's match against M&A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Cg522zYkn4), we can see that both teams are extremely well programmed and very consistent. M&A's robots, however, were faster, allowing them to be on offense for almost the entire match.

In [M&A's match against Boylebots Quadro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Gupdy-QfdE), the advantage of speed and accuracy is made clear. M&A's robots utilize role-switching and an agile drivetrain to get behind the ball as quickly as possible, then sprint towards the goal while strafing slightly to avoid defenders.
